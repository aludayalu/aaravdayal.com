<h2>About Me</h2>

<ul>
    <li>CEO and Founder of <a href="https://lumatozer.com/?ref=aaravdayal.com">Lumatozer</a> where we work on scaling technologies far beyond what has been achieved conventionally to date.</li>
    <li>I am a System Architect. I build and design large-scale efficient architecture and infrastructure.</li>
    <li>I am also a Full Stack Developer, self-proclaimed Network Engineer and Cyber Security Researcher.</li>
    <li>Currently working on a blockchain, LTZ-Chain - one of the world's fastest and most efficient blockchain to date.</li>
    <li>Also working on a language Vitality which has a fully reference counting based parallelized, non-invasive, non-STW memory architecture and enforces a 0 circular reference model. Vitality comes with its own runtime scheduler to provide functionality similar to goroutines and an async-await free architecture.</li>

    <li>Firm believer in God and the butterfly effect.</li>
    <li>I am an IronFallibilist - a person who holds a very strong belief set and follows it very strictly while constantly working towards breaking their beliefs to make their belief set even stronger.</li>
    <li>Worked with <a href="http://oneqid.com/?ref=aaravdayal.com">OneQid</a> as a System Design Architect where I built a totally end-to-end encrypted solution for storing and verifying identities such that once after verification of identities by Qid, users can share and prove the validity of one's personal details without the identities stored by Qid or any other centralized authority. This was enabled using LTZ-Chain.</li>
    <li>Worked at <a href="http://ladlifoundation.org/">Ladli NGO</a> (not for showing off to college) where I helped build <a href="http://voltour.org/">Voltour</a>, a social volunteering platform.</li>
    <li>Born in 2007</li>
    <li>Student at DPS R.K. Puram</li>
</ul>
